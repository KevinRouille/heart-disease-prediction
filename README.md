# Heart Disease Prediction Project

### Abstract
In this project, I analyzed data from UCI’s Machine Learning repository and then tested several supervised learning models that could help cardiologists to identify patients at risk of developing heart diseases. It seems that the Naïve Bayes classifier is the most performant in predicting occurrences of heart disease.
